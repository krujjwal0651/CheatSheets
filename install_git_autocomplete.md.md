The errors you encountered while setting up Git autocomplete in Zsh suggest issues with the `git-completion.zsh` script and its integration into your Zsh environment. Here's how to resolve these problems step-by-step:

---

### **1. Use the Correct Git Completion Script**

The `git-completion.zsh` script is not designed to be directly sourced. Instead, it should be placed in the `$fpath` directory and renamed as `_git`. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Directory for Zsh Functions**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/functions
```

2. **Download and Rename the Script**:

```bash
curl -o ~/.zsh/functions/_git https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh
```

3. **Update `$fpath` in `.zshrc`**:
Open your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following lines:

```bash
fpath=(~/.zsh/functions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit &amp;&amp; compinit
```

4. **Remove Cached Completion Files**:
Clear existing Zsh completion cache to prevent conflicts:

```bash
rm ~/.zcompdump*
```

5. **Reload Zsh Configuration**:
Apply the changes by sourcing `.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```


---

### **2. Test Git Autocomplete**

After completing the setup, test Git autocompletion by typing a partial command, such as `git che`, and pressing `TAB`. It should suggest completions like `checkout`.

---

### **3. Troubleshooting Common Errors**

#### **Error: `no such file or directory`**

- Ensure that the `_git` file exists in `~/.zsh/functions`. Verify its presence using:

```bash
ls ~/.zsh/functions/_git
```


#### **Error: `_tags:comptags: can only be called from completion function`**

- This error occurs if the completion system (`compinit`) is not properly initialized. Ensure you have:

```bash
autoload -Uz compinit &amp;&amp; compinit
```

in your `.zshrc`.


#### **Error: `(eval):1: no matches found: *:globbed-files`**

- Add this line to `.zshrc` to disable strict globbing rules:

```bash
setopt no_nomatch
```


#### **Error with Bash Completion Scripts**

If you are trying to use a Bash completion script (`git-completion.bash`) in Zsh, ensure compatibility by adding this line to `.zshrc`:

```bash
zstyle ':completion:*:*:git:*' script ~/.zsh/git-completion.bash
```

However, using the dedicated Zsh script (`git-completion.zsh`) is recommended.

---

### **4. Alternative Solution with Oh-My-Zsh**

If you are using Oh-My-Zsh, simply enable the `git` plugin for Git autocompletion:

1. Open `.zshrc` and add `git` to the plugins list:

```bash
plugins=(git)
```

2. Reload `.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```


This approach simplifies Git autocomplete setup and avoids manual script configuration.

---

By following these steps, Git autocompletion should work seamlessly in your Zsh terminal without errors.
